      Do you have the full Basler pylon Camera Software Suite installed in addition to pypylon?

      > In the pylon Viewer the keys `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + i` will capture OS / software version information, that you can paste here.

      The below command will output python/pypylon and system versions. Please use the python interpreter used in your project to execute

      ```python
      import sys, pypylon.pylon, platform
      print(f'python: {sys.version}')
      print(f'platform: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}/{platform.release()}')
      print(f'pypylon: {pypylon.pylon.__version__} / {".".join([str(i) for i in pypylon.pylon.GetPylonVersion()])}')
      ```

      And in case of containerized applications also list the operating system and platform of the base system and platform!
