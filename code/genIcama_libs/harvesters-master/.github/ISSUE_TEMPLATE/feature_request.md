**What is the goal that you want to achieve by the request?**
Please describe a clear and concise description of what the motivation is. For example:

As a user, I expect Harvester does not to block other threads while it is executing the `fetch` method call because my application needs to keep being reactive.

**Additional context**
I would guess a situation where the `fetch` method call can't achieve the expected outcome, for example, no buffer was delivered, etc. In such a case, it would be great if we could have a way to understand that the `fetch` call did not deliver anything to us.
